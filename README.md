# SWE40006-Group-Project
This is a team project and worth 30% of your final grade. It intends to evaluate your understanding and practical skills of Software Deployment and Evolution with the knowledge of Deployment Fundamentals, Deployment Scripts, Evolution of software and deployment, DevOps. There are four main tasks you are asked to finish in this project.
In this project, you are required to implement a practical application based on the project. The project assessment involves a project brief, the project demonstration, and a final project report (Team-based). This particular project task is to design and construct a DevOps tool chain which is assessed toward 35% of your unit grade.

Always engage in the discussion forums and further announcements for the project-related matters which will be available in Canvas. You are responsible for checking Canvas on a regular basis to stay informed with regard to any updates about the project.

The project requires you to design and construct a DevOps server pipeline. You can select and install the necessary tools of your choice to support a DevOps team using multiple (virtual) servers and infrastructure. You can choose the level up for your attempt.

For the completion of the project following are the steps you need to complete:

Level 1: Create a simple DevOps pipeline including a code repository server, a CI/build server, a test server, and a prod. server.

Level 2: Complete task 1 and Add instrumentation to the prod server which can gather stats on server performance.

Level 3: Complete task 2 and deploy a simple application using the DevOps pipeline. Verify that your application works accurately and is accessible.

Level 4: Complete task 3 and test the automation scripts by changing the source code to trigger a deferred or automatic deployment of the new build.

Assessment Requirements:

Project Brief: For your project brief submission, the team supposed to identify the tools that you will use to build the DevOps pipeline and three environments. You could use something like Jenkins for CI, build server and test server, and AWS instance for Production server. To maintain your code repository, you could use GitHub or any other collaborative tool you feel comfortable using.

In your project brief submission document, please provide a brief explanation of DevOps server pipeline. Explain each of the tools you have selected to complete your project stating how and why would you use them. Provide a clear explanation justifying your selection of tools.

Project Presentation: Before you present your work, the team must present all levels of attempt. Work on the tasks sequentially keeping a screen of every sub-task you perform to complete the tasks at every level for project report submission. The assessment is due in week 11 and you will be presenting your work in your respective tutorial workshops.

For presentation, you can support your work with some presentation slides (4-8 slides).  Slides could talk about the selected tools, problems faced and how they were resolved, code demonstration of the deployed project. The presentation will be 15 minutes long followed by Q&A.

Project Report: The team is required to submit a project report providing evidence of completion of the various sub-tasks. The evidence can include screenshots/clear images (labeled with captions), pasted text from console windows and description of what you did and any errors/unresolved problems. Also document how well you were able to complete the project and the lessons learned.
